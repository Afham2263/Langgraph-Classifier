# 💥 LangGraph Classifier: Confidence-Driven Text Classification with Fallback

**A self-healing NLP pipeline that doesn't just guess — it checks itself before it wrecks itself.**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **LangGraph-powered text classification system** designed to prioritize **correctness** over blind automation.

* 🔍 Fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis
* 🧠 Confidence-check mechanism using LangGraph DAG
* 🛡️ Fallback strategies: **zero-shot classifier** or **manual user clarification**
* 🖥️ Clean CLI interface with **explainable predictions**
* 📊 Logging for decisions, confidence, and fallback tracking

---

## 🛠️ Features

* ✅ **Transformer fine-tuning (LoRA)** on a sentiment dataset
* 🧩 **Modular LangGraph DAG** with custom nodes:

  * `InferenceNode`: Makes the prediction
  * `ConfidenceCheck`: Decides if prediction is confident enough
  * `FallbackNode`: Asks for clarification or uses zero-shot
* 🧵 **CLI Loop** for interaction with user
* 📈 **Logging system** for predictions, fallback use, and confidence scores
* 🧠 Smart defaults but totally hackable

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Langgraph-Classifier.git
cd Langgraph-Classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 💾 Model Setup

Since GitHub hates large files, download the fine-tuned model from here:

👉 [Download Fine-tuned DistilBERT (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pc0qavHOBYGJQhymgKH1B1txiql4u7KE)

After downloading, **extract the model into the root folder** like this:

```
Langgraph-Classifier/
├── model/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── pytorch_model.bin
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   └── ...
```

---

### ⚙️ Run the Classifier

```bash
python cli_interface.py
```

You'll see:

```
🤖 Welcome to the LangGraph Classifier CLI!
Type a sentence to classify (or type 'exit' to quit):
```

Example:

```
> This movie was painfully slow and boring.

🔍 Classifying input text...
[InferenceNode] Predicted label: Positive | Confidence: 0.52
[ConfidenceCheckNode] Confidence too low. Triggering fallback...
[FallbackNode] Did you mean this to be a POSITIVE or NEGATIVE statement?
User: Negative
Final Label: Negative ✅
```

## 🧬 LangGraph DAG Design

Here's how the pipeline flows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B[InferenceNode]
    B -->|High Confidence| D[End]
    B -->|Low Confidence| C[FallbackNode]
    C --> D
```

## 📜 Logging Output

Every prediction is logged with:

* Timestamp
* Input sentence
* Predicted label
* Confidence score
* Whether fallback was used

Logs live in `/logs/classification_log.txt`
